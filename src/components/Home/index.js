            Full-stack web developer with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React.js, Express.js,
            Node.js, MongoDB, MySQL, ORM, Web API and responsive web design skills
            dedicated to making the web a more accessible and user friendly experience.
            A retail management background has developed my strengths in problem solving,
            teamwork, meeting deadlines and successfully grew a retail store project
            into a profitable asset. Obtained a degree in Computer Science at the University
            of Nottingham giving a solid understanding of coding fundamentals and the Monash
            University Full Stack Coding Bootcamp has built my skills in web development.
            Led a team of four to develop a product that helps users to save money on food
            and cooking during the Covid-19 2020 lockdown in Victoria with a recipe budgeting
            application. I am motivated to contribute my full-stack web skills and computer
            science background to build better experiences on the web in a fast paced
            environment with a professional team.
